In this repository we look at various examples to work with the [polmineR](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR) package using [binderhub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io).

To launch a new instance of the examples notebooks on [GESIS Notebooks](https://notebooks.gesis.org), please click on the `launch binder` button. This will launch a JupyterLab environment where the examples are present in the notebook `polmineR-examples.ipynb`.

These examples are taken from the [README documentation](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR#core-functions) about the core functions present in [polmineR](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR).

You can also start a RStudio IDE environment using the following launch link.

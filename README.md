In this repository we look at various examples to work with the [polmineR](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR) package using [binderhub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io).

To launch a new instance of the examples notebooks on [GESIS Notebooks](https://notebooks.gesis.org), please click on the `launch binder` button. This will launch a JupyterLab environment where the examples are present in the notebook `polmineR-examples.ipynb`.

These examples are taken from the [README documentation](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR#core-functions) about the core functions present in [polmineR](https://github.com/PolMine/polmineR).

You can also start a RStudio IDE environment using the following launch link.

The work environments created by the above launch buttons are ephemeral, i.e. the changes made inside the notebooks will not be saved the next time you would open the same link. If you would like to create a persistent environment, you can use [GESIS Notebooks](https://notebooks.gesis.org) to create a [persistent binderhub](https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub) environment. This allows you to save your changes and continue working on your project even after the current session closes. This requires you to sign up on [GESIS Notebooks](https://notebooks.gesis.org).
